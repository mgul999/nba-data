# nba-data

A collection of Jupyter notebooks where I analyze NBA statistics: "Generate_Dataset" uses an API to pull data from basketball-reference and assembles it into a CSV containing all per-game statistics since 1980. "PPG" is a series of different models that attempt to predict NBA players' scoring.  

Since Jupyter notebooks don't display as nicely in GitHub, click [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/mgul999/nba-data/blob/master/PPG.ipynb) to see the PPG notebook rendered properly in nbviewer.
